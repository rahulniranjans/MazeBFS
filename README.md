# MazeBFS

Here's a full BFS Maze solver.
It returns a full shortest path to the end point if found.
MazeProject is an Image which contains the maze that is being traversed. The maze has been converted into a graph. The graph is shown in GraphMaze.
The representations of nodes 1-44 are themselves. Whereas, The alphabets have been represented as shown:
a	-	45
b	-	46
c	-	47
d	-	48
e	-	49
f	-	50
g	-	51
h	-	52
i	-	53
j	-	54
k	-	55
l	-	56
m	-	57
n	-	58
o	-	59
p	-	60
q	-	61
s	-	62
t	-	63
u	-	64
v	-	65
w	-	66
y	-	67
z	-	68
g1	-	0
g2	-	69

The code follows the BFS approach and the starting point is A. The goal state is g1 or g2, whichever is closer.

The program is designed to terminate on reaching one of the goal states.
